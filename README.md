# Tetrigo

A Golang implementation of Tetris, attempting to follow the official [2009 Tetris Design Guideline](https://github.com/Broderick-Westrope/tetrigo/tree/main/docs/2009-Tetris-Design-Guideline.pdf).

This project is a work in progress. I plan to separate the included TUI (Terminal User Interface) from the game logic. This will allow it to be easily reused to create game variants and other user interfaces.

Please feel free to open issues with suggestions, bugs, etc.
